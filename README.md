**Kairos** is a powerful and advanced tool designed to extract parameters from URLs or subdomains. Whether you need to extract parameters from a single URL or bulk URLs from a file, Kairos provides you with an efficient, multi-threaded solution for fast web security assessments, bug bounty hunting, and web scraping tasks.

## Features

- Extracts query parameters from individual URLs or bulk URLs from a file.
- Supports multi-threaded processing for faster extraction.
- Handles both GET parameters and POST-based data.
- Custom HTTP headers support for bypassing certain security measures.
- Saves unique parameters into a file for later analysis.
- Useful for penetration testing, security audits, and bug bounty hunting.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. If not, download and install Python from the official site:

### Install Dependencies
Before running the tool, install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the required libraries such as `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and others for the tool to work seamlessly.

## Usage

### Process a file with subdomains/URLs:
To process a file containing a list of URLs or subdomains, use the following command:

```bash
python kairos.py -i subdomains.txt -o parameters.txt
```

This command extracts parameters from all the URLs listed in `subdomains.txt` and saves them into `parameters.txt`.

### Process a single URL:
To process a single URL, use the `-u` flag as shown below:

```bash
python kairos.py -u "http://example.com?query=123&token=xyz" -o parameters.txt
```

This will extract parameters from the given URL and save them into `parameters.txt`.

### Use Custom Headers:
Specify custom headers for the HTTP requests with the `--headers` flag. For example:

```bash
python kairos.py -i subdomains.txt -o parameters.txt --headers '{"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}'
```

### Multi-threading for Faster Processing:
Use the `-t` flag to increase the number of threads, speeding up the processing. For example, to use 10 threads:

```bash
python kairos.py -i subdomains.txt -o parameters.txt -t 10
```

### Displaying Help:
To get more details about the usage and available options, use the `-h` flag:

```bash
python kairos.py -h
```

## Output
The tool will output the unique parameters extracted from the URLs into a text file (default is `parameters.txt`). This file will contain a list of all the unique parameters extracted from the URLs or subdomains.

## Example Output:
```
query
token
id
page
user
```
